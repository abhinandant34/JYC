            <div className='about-jyc-data'>JUIT Youth Club (JYC) is the name of enthusiasm, development, consistency and effort. It is the body which
                widens student's view from academics to various fields such as sports, literary, cultural and technical and provides opportunity to explore
                them. It encourages in student's expression, celebration, recognition and integration. It helps students acquire qualities like team work,
                sportsmanship and leadership. Not only this, it retreats students from academics load by organizing events, fests and other extra-curricular
                activities. Focusing on technical, literary, sports, and cultural scopes these competitive activities, apart from serving as a relief from
                intense academic load, present an opportunity to instill confidence, encourage teamwork and give students a strong sense of achievement and
                belonging.
